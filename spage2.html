<h1> Mens Sport </h1>
<h2> 1. Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 39 </h2>
<img src="shoeimgmens5.jpg" height="750px" width="750px">
<p> Ready for every run and any workout, few shoes offer versatility and reliability like the Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 39.
The trusted workhorse is a neutral running shoe that uses a full-length React foam midsole for an energetic and bouncy ride. 
Compared to the Pegasus 38, designers reduced the weight of the Pegasus 39 and added two Zoom Air units in the forefoot for extra pop during takeoff.
One thing hasn’t changed, however—the Peg is still one of the best Nike running shoes of all time.
With a speedy look and nimble ride, the updated Nike Pegasus 39 is the right tool for easy miles after work or fast days on the track.</p>
<h2> 2.Nike Zoom Fly 5 </h2>
<img src="shoeimgmens4.jpg" height="750px" width="750px">
<p> The Nike Zoom Fly 5 is a well-cushioned, carbon-plated training shoe suited to long, slow runs.
 It has excxellent stability and a muted forward-tipping sensation during toe-offs. 
Version 5 has a more traditional, padded upper, a full-length ZoomX core which provides extra cushioning and a wider midsole base for extra stability.
 The Zoom Fly 5 is the slowest Zoom Fly version to date but also the most comfortable. </p>
 <h2> 3. Nike ZoomX Invincible Run Flyknit 2 </h2>
 <img src="shoeimgmens3.jpg" height="750px" width="750px">
 <p> The Nike Invincible Run Flyknit 2 is the max-cushioned trainer with the softest and bounciest ride on the market.
 Its ZoomX midsole has remarkable energy return and cushioning which makes it great for easy runs as well as steady-paced runs.
 Version 2 of the Invincible Run is almost exactly the same as the first version. It has new shoelaces and a tweaked upper but the ride is identical. <p>
<h2> 4. Nike Pegasus Trail 3 </h2>
<img src="shoeimgmens2.jpg" height="750px" width="750px">
<p> The Nike Trail Pegasus 3 is a versatile shoe that both a beginner and experienced trail runner can appreciate. 
It works great both on and off road with a comfortable ride that can go the distance.
 It being well rounded is unfortunately a downfall in the traction department, but it is otherwise a perfect shoe from Nike. </p>
 <h2> 5. Nike Air Zoom SuperRep 3
</h2>
<img src="shoeimgmens1.jpg" height="750px" width="750px">
 <p>
The Nike Superrep 3 is the ideal indoor class shoe for gym goers who love group exercise, or HIIT workouts.
 It’s seen big improvements since previous versions and looks great to boot. </p>

 <h2> 1. Nike Air Force 1 </h2>
 <img src="shoeimgboys1.jpg" height="750px" width="750px">
<p> 
It's safe to say that they are the type of shoe you'll love if you don't want to buy a new pair every season.

<h2> 2. Nike Dunk Low </h2> 
<img src="shoeimgboys2.jpg" height="750px" width="750px">
<p>Are Nike Dunks comfortable? They are comfortable but not for all day wear. 
If you're just out and about for an hour or two it's the perfect shoe, but for a long walk around a city this shoe doesn't offer the support like its newer Nike counterparts. </p>
<h2> 3. Nike Future Field </h2>
<img src="shoeimgboys3.jpg" height="750px" width="750px">
<p>Football. Baseball. Soccer. Or even running around the field at recess.

Plus, they're versatile and comfy to wear off the field, too—like, going to get ice cream for a postgame and post-practice treat. </p>

Choose their favorite indoor court activity—volleyball, basketball, tennis, handball, or gym class—and lace up! </p>
<h2> 5. Nike Dunk High </h2>
<img src="shoeimgboys5.jpg" height="750px" width="750px">
<p>Vintage style soars sky-high with the return of the Nike Dunk High.
 Refreshed for a new generation of ballers, durable leather overlays, plush ankle padding and bold purple and gold details make these kicks a slam dunk.</p>
